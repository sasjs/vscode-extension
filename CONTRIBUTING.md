## What's in the project

- This project contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
- `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  - The plugin registers the `sasjs-vscode-extension.executeCode` command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesn’t yet need to load the plugin.
- `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will hook up your command(s) to the execution framework.
  - The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
  - We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.
  - The command implementation for the `executeCode` command is located in `executeCode.ts`.

## Get up and running straight away

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `SASjs`.
- Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
- Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

- You can open the full set of the VS Code API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

- Open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `Extension Tests`.
- Press `F5` to run the tests in a new window with your extension loaded.
- See the output of the test result in the debug console.
- Make changes to `src/test/suite/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test/suite` folder.
  - The provided test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  - You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
- `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
